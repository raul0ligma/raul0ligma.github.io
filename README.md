## background

**currently**
- exploring what's next in the space and working on new ideas

[**brahma**](https://brahma.fi)
- architected and led development of [Console](https://brahma.fi) backend, building and [scaling](https://dune.com/rahul69/infra-bench) core infrastructure from ground up - a non custodial DeFi execution environment built on safe's custody rails with granular access control, transaction policies, and automated execution across 11+ networks processing over 1B+ in transaction volume with 195K+ accounts managed
- led [Console Kit](https://brahma.fi/console-kit), a DeFi native automation toolkit leveraging Temporal for durable workflow execution, policy guardrails, and chain agnostic execution without any onchain deployment, powering [Brahma Agents](https://web.archive.org/web/20250705070753/https://agents.brahma.fi/)(9.5K+ agents launched) and integrated by external teams like [creator-bid](https://x.com/CreatorBid/status/1854479583497572557), [ooga-booga](https://x.com/raul0ligma/status/1922936727640912213) and [tempestFi](https://x.com/AbishekFi/status/1907086608224162114) with 850K+ transactions settled 
- built backend for [Brahma Connect](https://github.com/Brahma-fi/brahma-connect), a chained execution framework enabling transaction batching across dApps with simulation.
- built comprehensive monitoring and execution system for [Gearbox TopGear vault](https://x.com/BrahmaFi/status/1589672841301340160) which managed leveraged positions in [high volatility markets](https://x.com/BrahmaFi/status/1646897478464073728), analyzed on chain data for risk assessment, and built fast execution pipelines to prevent liquidations
- worked on backend monitoring and execution infrastructure for DeltaNeutral vaults, including automated vault operations managing cross chain fund movement and position rebalancing
- built [Karma V2](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908024053/https://karma.brahma.fi/), a comprehensive scoring system with ETL pipelines indexing 30K+ addresses across multiple chains, including both on-chain and off-chain data (Twitter activity, Discord interactions), with interactive bots for community engagement

[**ewar games**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220221160153/https://ewar.in/)
- architected and scaled [real-money gaming](https://www.storyboard18.com/gaming-news/exclusive-indias-gaming-industry-gets-clarity-rmg-sector-to-be-regulated-by-meity-47355.htm) infrastructure from prototype to 2.3M+ users handling 275K+ monthly transactions ($0.12 to $2K per session)
- built high throughput matchmaking engine processing 55K+ games/month with optimized real-time communication channels connecting players to game servers
- integrated [MMO platforms](https://www.smartfoxserver.com) and [multiplayer frameworks](https://colyseus.io) for game hosting and lobby management
- built in house streaming and tournament systems with real time leaderboards, coupled with fraud detection pipelines analyzing concurrent game sessions and transactions
- built the platform from scratch as one of the founding engineers, then led scaling and architecting for 2 years before getting shut down due to government regulations

**altworld**
- built user management and session handling systems for Unity based metaverse platform
- set up and benchmarked [Photon Engine](https://www.photonengine.com) servers on Windows for hosting multiplayer sessions
- left after 6 months as metaverse tech didn't offer much technical learning and wasn't as promising
