## about me

started off with ms-dos c compiler blowing my mind, playing with nodejs, then selling a few projects built on node in high-school.

then joined a [RMG product](https://web.archive.org/web/20220221160153/https://ewar.in/) as a founding intern from a hackathon, and went on to scaling it to a million registered users, designed matchmaking/transactional/gaming/streaming/tournaments systems,
learned how to infinitely gobble up your queues, compress payloads using flatbuffers, experiment with [mmo](https://www.smartfoxserver.com) and [multiplayer](https://colyseus.io/) frameworks. built small [tools](https://github.com/raul0ligma/xerxes) and learned what happens when you don't obfuscate your code,
to eventually getting shut because gambling on games is illegal, but it's fun to build.

got interested in blockchain, metaverses were the closest to blockchains and games, joined another startup, figuring and building a metaverse, played with windows server profiling and running [photon](https://www.photonengine.com/) instances, did initial designs for systems, but left since vibes didn't match. started learning about chains, games, and doing more hackathons, and eventually got hired to build karma out of a hackathon and now building and scaling the tech at brahma.

writing code for the first time and even now, feels like the fastest form of expressing ideas and then scaling them. it helps me turn raw ideas into working systems which people interact with.

from transistors (now qbits) to systems handling millions of concurrent users, I'm still in awe, trying to learn everyday.
